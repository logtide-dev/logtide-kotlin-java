## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in LogTide Kotlin SDK, please report it by emailing **support@logtide.dev** (or your preferred contact).

Please do **NOT** file a public issue.

We will respond to your report within 48 hours and work with you to understand and address the issue.

## Security Best Practices

When using the SDK:

1. **Protect API Keys**: Never commit API keys to version control
2. **Use HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS endpoints in production
3. **Limit Buffer Size**: Configure appropriate `maxBufferSize` to prevent memory exhaustion
4. **Update Regularly**: Keep the SDK updated to the latest version
